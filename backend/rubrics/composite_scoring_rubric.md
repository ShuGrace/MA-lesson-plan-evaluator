# Composite Lesson Plan Evaluation Rubric
## Culturally Responsive Place-Based Learning in Aotearoa New Zealand
## Framework Version 3.0 (Updated 2025-11-21)

### Overall Scoring Framework

This rubric integrates four theoretical dimensions with differentiated weighting to reflect New Zealand's educational context and Te Tiriti obligations:

| Dimension | Code | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|------|--------|-----------|
| Place-Based Learning | PBL | 25% | Foundation for local contextual learning and community engagement |
| Cultural Responsiveness & Māori Perspectives (Integrated) | CRMP | 35% | Highest weight due to Te Tiriti obligations and bicultural commitments |
| Critical Pedagogy & Student Engagement | CP | 25% | Promotes transformation, critical consciousness, and active learning |
| Lesson Design Quality | LDQ | 15% | Ensures technical soundness and instructional coherence |

**Composite Score Calculation:**
Composite Score = (PBL × 0.25) + (CRMP × 0.35) + (CP × 0.25) + (LDQ × 0.15)


**Framework Changes in v3.0:**
- Fully integrated Cultural Responsiveness and Māori Perspectives into single dimension (CRMP) with 10 unified indicators
- Added new Lesson Design Quality dimension (LDQ) with 7 indicators
- Removed separation between general cultural and Māori-specific sections
- Updated all indicator codes and weights

## DIMENSION 1: PLACE-BASED LEARNING (25%)
### Indicators: PBL-01 to PBL-06

### 5.0 - EXCEPTIONAL
**Deeply Place-Embedded & Transformative**

Characteristics:
- ✅ Multiple specific, named local places referenced (e.g., "Waitematā Harbour," "Maungawhau/Mt Eden," not generic "local park")
- ✅ Substantive community partnerships with reciprocal relationships (named organizations, kaumātua, local experts)
- ✅ Students address actual, documented community problems with real stakeholders and potential for genuine impact
- ✅ Seamlessly integrates 3+ disciplines through place-based inquiry
- ✅ Mātauranga Māori central to understanding of place, not add-on (e.g., kaitiakitanga, mauri, whakapapa connections)
- ✅ Critically examines colonization, power dynamics, and injustice related to place

Example Indicators:
- Students collaborate with Auckland Council on protecting Ōrākei Basin wetland
- Lesson integrates whakapapa connections to whenua, ecological monitoring (science), historical land use analysis (social studies), statistical comparison (maths), and place-based poetry in Te Reo (literacy)

## COMPOSITE SCORE INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### 90-100: EXCEPTIONAL - Exemplary Practice
**Profile:**
Deep integration across all four dimensions. Lesson demonstrates:
- Deeply embedded in specific local context with genuine community partnerships (PBL)
- Richly culturally responsive with mātauranga Māori central and Te Tiriti aligned (CRMP)
- Liberatory approach with high student agency and critical consciousness (CP)
- Exemplary instructional design quality (LDQ)

**Calculation Example:**
PBL=95, CRMP=92, CP=90, LDQ=88 Composite = (95×0.25) + (92×0.35) + (90×0.25) + (88×0.15) = 23.75 + 32.2 + 22.5 + 13.2 = 91.65 ≈ 92/100


**Recommendation:** Share as exemplar. Minor refinements only.

---

### 80-89: EXCELLENT - Strong Practice
**Profile:**
Strong evidence across all dimensions with room for enhancement:
- Strong local connections and community engagement (PBL)
- Clear cultural responsiveness and Māori perspectives (CRMP)
- Evidence of critical thinking and active engagement (CP)
- Sound instructional design (LDQ)

**Calculation Example:**
PBL=75, CRMP=72, CP=70, LDQ=76 Composite = (75×0.25) + (72×0.35) + (70×0.25) + (76×0.15) = 18.75 + 25.2 + 17.5 + 11.4 = 72.85 ≈ 73/100


**Recommendation:** Targeted improvements needed; suitable for implementation with revisions.

---

### 60-69: DEVELOPING - Adequate with Significant Growth Areas
**Profile:**
Shows emerging elements but needs substantial development:
- Some local references (PBL)
- Limited cultural responsiveness (CRMP)
- Minimal critical pedagogy (CP)
- Basic instructional design (LDQ)

**Calculation Example:**
PBL=65, CRMP=60, CP=62, LDQ=68 Composite = (65×0.25) + (60×0.35) + (62×0.25) + (68×0.15) = 16.25 + 21 + 15.5 + 10.2 = 62.95 ≈ 63/100


**Recommendation:** Requires significant revision. Provide targeted professional development.

---

### 50-59: EMERGING - Substantial Development Needed
**Profile:**
Minimal evidence of framework dimensions:
- Generic content (PBL)
- Cultural diversity minimally addressed (CRMP)
- Teacher-centered transmission (CP)
- Weak instructional design (LDQ)

**Calculation Example:**
PBL=55, CRMP=50, CP=52, LDQ=58 Composite = (55×0.25) + (50×0.35) + (52×0.25) + (58×0.15) = 13.75 + 17.5 + 13 + 8.7 = 52.95 ≈ 53/100


**Recommendation:** Fundamental redesign required. Intensive professional development recommended.

---

### 0-49: INADEQUATE - Does Not Meet Standards
**Profile:**
Fails to meet framework standards; may be culturally harmful:
- No local connection (PBL)
- Culturally unresponsive or harmful (CRMP)
- Oppressive pedagogy (CP)
- Fundamentally flawed design (LDQ)

**Calculation Example:**
PBL=40, CRMP=35, CP=38, LDQ=42 Composite = (40×0.25) + (35×0.35) + (38×0.25) + (42×0.15) = 10 + 12.25 + 9.5 + 6.3 = 38.05 ≈ 38/100


**Recommendation:** Do NOT implement. Complete redesign required with cultural consultation.

**CRITICAL CONCERNS:**
- If CRMP < 50: Violates Te Tiriti obligations; requires mandatory cultural consultation
- If any dimension < 30: Serious deficiency requiring immediate attention
- If multiple dimensions < 50: Fundamental conceptual issues; comprehensive professional development needed

   - PBL: Evaluate 6 indicators (PBL-01 to PBL-06) using 1-5 scale
   - CRMP: Evaluate 10 indicators (CRMP-01 to CRMP-10) using 1-5 scale
   - CP: Evaluate 8 indicators (CP-01 to CP-08) using 1-5 scale
   - LDQ: Evaluate 7 indicators (LDQ-01 to LDQ-07) using 1-5 scale

2. **Calculate Dimension Scores:**
   - Convert 1-5 scores to 0-100 scale: (score/5.0) × 100
   - Example: If PBL indicators average 4.2/5.0, PBL score = 84/100

3. **Calculate Composite Score:**
Composite = (PBL × 0.25) + (CRMP × 0.35) + (CP × 0.25) + (LDQ × 0.15)


4. **Interpret Composite Score:** Use interpretation guide above

5. **Provide Dimension-Specific Feedback:** Use rubric descriptions for each dimension

6. **Identify Priorities:**
- Flag CRMP < 50 as CRITICAL (Te Tiriti concern)
- Flag any dimension < 40 as requiring immediate attention
- Prioritize improvements based on weights (CRMP has highest priority)
