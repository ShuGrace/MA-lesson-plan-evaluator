  "lesson_plan_text": "Students will investigate the local wetlands ecosystem near our school in Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland). Working with iwi kaitiaki (Māori guardians), they will learn about traditional Māori conservation practices (kaitiakitanga) and measure water quality using both scientific methods and mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge). Students will document native species like pūkeko and tuna (eels), identify threats to the ecosystem, and develop an action plan to protect this taonga (treasure). They will present their findings to the local community board using both English and te reo Māori, demonstrating their understanding of both Western science and Indigenous knowledge systems.",
